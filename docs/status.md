## Latest Updates

### Frontend Testing Implementation (TEST-002)

Implemented frontend component tests using Vitest:

1. Successful Component Tests:
   - UI components (Button) with 7 passing tests
   - TransactionNotification with 10 passing tests
   - TransactionHistory with 5 passing tests
   - All basic UI component tests passing successfully

2. In Progress:
   - Hook tests for useTransaction need mocking fixes
   - Contract integration tests need expectation updates

3. Next Steps:
   - Fix useTransaction hook test mocks by implementing a better testing strategy
   - Update contract test expectations to match development mode values
   - Add tests for form components and wizards
   - Implement snapshot testing

### Deployment Planning

With most functional features completed, the focus is shifting to deployment and testing tasks:

1. Priority deployment tasks:
   - Deploy contracts to Moonbase Alpha (DEPLOY-001)
   - Verify deployed contracts (DEPLOY-002)
   - Set up frontend deployment on Vercel (DEPLOY-003)

2. Supporting tasks:
   - Configure environment variables (DEPLOY-004)
   - Complete testing infrastructure (TEST-001, TEST-003)
   - Create manual test plan (TEST-004)

### Next Steps

Based on our assessment, the recommended path forward is:

1. Complete testing infrastructure:
   - Fix remaining test issues in TEST-002
   - Start smart contract tests with Foundry (TEST-001)

2. Begin deployment process:
   - Deploy to Moonbase Alpha (DEPLOY-001)
   - Set up contract verification (DEPLOY-002)

3. Prepare for production:
   - Configure Vercel deployment (DEPLOY-003)
   - Set up environment variables (DEPLOY-004)
   - Implement E2E tests (TEST-003)
   - Create comprehensive test plan (TEST-004)
