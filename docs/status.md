## Latest Updates

### Loan Model Simplification

**Date: November 16, 2023**

We've simplified the loan model to focus on core components, making the application more accessible for learning purposes:

1. Core Loan Data Model:

   - Reduced to three essential properties: amount, interest rate, and term
   - Made other fields like purpose and collateral optional
   - Removed complex fields like borrower information and terms/conditions

2. User Interface Simplification:

   - Streamlined the LoanDetailsForm to only include essential fields
   - Reduced the LoanCreationWizard from 5 steps to just 2 (Details and Confirmation)
   - Updated the MetadataConfirmation component to display the simplified data model
   - Improved the preview visualization to focus on core loan attributes

3. Schema and Validation:

   - Updated the Zod schemas to reflect the simplified model
   - Maintained essential validation rules for the core fields
   - Streamlined the AI enhancement process to work with the simplified data

4. Next steps:
   - Further simplify the metadata structure for IPFS
   - Update the contract integration to work with the simplified model
   - Add clearer documentation about the loan model for new developers

### Project Simplification

**Date: November 15, 2023**

We've simplified the project structure to make development and maintenance easier:

1. UI Simplification:

   - Removed unnecessary test components (TestToast and TestContractImport)
   - Standardized on a single UI library (shadcn/ui with Radix primitives)
   - Improved development workflow with focused scripts

2. Application structure:

   - Focused on the main frontend app for development
   - Excluded the unnecessary web app from default development
   - Maintained the AI server as an optional component

3. Documentation:

   - Updated README with clear project structure
   - Added simplified development commands
   - Documented the technology stack and component organization

4. Next steps:
   - Continue streamlining package dependencies
   - Consider removing unused applications (docs, web)
   - Further consolidate UI components for consistency

### TypeScript Error Fixes for Development Mode

**Date: November 12, 2023**

We've resolved several TypeScript errors that were occurring during development mode:

1. Fixed metadata service issues:

   - Properly initialized Ajv and addFormats with type assertions to fix constructor error
   - Added inline JSON schema instead of importing from a file
   - Fixed handling of optional properties in EnhancedLoanData
   - Fixed package.json exports to properly order types, import, and require

2. Fixed contract integration issues:

   - Added proper type extensions for client interfaces
   - Fixed missing 'chain' property in writeContract calls
   - Added explicit type annotations for parameters to avoid 'implicit any' errors
   - Added proper extension imports (.js) for ESM compatibility
   - Added ExtendedLoanData interface to handle additional properties needed by the service
   - Fixed package.json exports to properly order types, import, and require

3. Verification results:

   - Successfully built @loanchain/metadata and @loanchain/contract-integration packages
   - Both packages now compile without TypeScript errors
   - ESM compatibility maintained with proper .js extensions in imports

4. Remaining issues:
   - There's a TypeScript error in the ai-server package related to express route controllers
   - May need to address additional issues in other packages

### Frontend Import Fix (Technical Debt)

**Date: March 27, 2023**

We've resolved issues with the package import structure:

1. Identified and fixed module resolution issues:

   - Found import error with `@loanchain/contract-integration` in frontend
   - Fixed ESM/CommonJS compatibility issues in packages
   - Implemented local copy approach to isolate contract integration

2. Technical approach:

   - Created local TypeScript interfaces for dependency isolation
   - Copied necessary contract integration code to frontend
   - Simplified implementation to avoid complex dependencies
   - Added test components to verify imports work correctly

3. Next steps:
   - Review and optimize the workspace package structure
   - Set up proper environment variables for different environments
   - Complete the implementation of contract integration tests

### Smart Contract Integration (TOKEN-004)

**Date: June 5, 2023**

We've successfully implemented the smart contract integration for the loan platform:

1. Created a dedicated `contract-integration` package with the following components:

   - Contract service for interacting with the LoanToken smart contract
   - Metadata service that combines IPFS storage with contract operations
   - Network configuration for different blockchain environments

2. Implemented key functionality:

   - Minting loan tokens with metadata
   - Retrieving loan data from the blockchain
   - Checking permissions (minter role)
   - Estimating gas fees

3. Frontend integration:
   - Connected the LoanCreationWizard with the contract services
   - Added role-based permission checking
   - Enhanced the MetadataConfirmation component with real blockchain interaction
   - Implemented proper error handling and user feedback
   - Fixed package importing issues by creating local copies of contract integration

### Remaining Tasks

- Set up proper environment variables for contract addresses
- Deploy and test on Moonbase Alpha testnet
- Implement loan viewing and management functionality

## Previous Updates

### Metadata Confirmation UI (TOKEN-003)

**Date: June 3, 2023**

We've successfully implemented the metadata confirmation UI:

1. Created the `MetadataConfirmation` component that displays:

   - Formatted and raw JSON views of the metadata
   - Visual risk indicators
   - User agreement checkbox
   - Navigation controls

2. Added the `GasFeeEstimator` component with:

   - Transaction priority selection
   - Fee estimation display
   - Information tooltips

3. Integrated both components into the LoanCreationWizard flow

   - Added as the final step of the loan creation process
   - Connected to the form submission handler

4. Fixed wallet connection issues:
   - Created debugging tools
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Restructured the app's provider hierarchy

## Project Status Update - Core Simplification

**Date: Current Date**

### Completed Items

- Simplified the EnhancedLoanData model to focus on core components: amount, interest rate, and term
- Updated LoanDetailsForm to only include essential fields
- Fixed compatibility issues between different interface definitions in the packages
- Added development mode fallbacks in contract.service.ts and metadata.service.ts to enable the app to run without blockchain connectivity
- Made LoanCreationWizard more resilient to handle cases when services are unavailable
- Simplified the loan form schema to match the simplified loan model

### Current Focus

- Ensuring the application works in development mode without external dependencies
- Streamlining the core loan creation process
- Making the application more resilient to service outages or connection issues

### Issues and Blockers

- Different type definitions between packages causing TypeScript errors - _RESOLVED_
- Missing error handling when services are unavailable - _RESOLVED_
- Contract integration issues in development mode - _RESOLVED_

### Next Steps

- Test simplified loan creation end-to-end
- Further refine UI components for a better user experience
- Consider adding a demo mode toggle to explicitly enable/disable blockchain integration
- Create a simplified onboarding flow for new users

### Notes

The application has been streamlined to focus on the core loan concept: amount, interest rate, and term. Optional fields like collateral and purpose are still available but no longer required. The application now gracefully degrades when blockchain integration is unavailable, making it easier to develop and test without a wallet connection.
