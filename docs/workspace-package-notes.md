# Workspace Package Integration Notes

## Current Architecture

The LoanChain project uses a monorepo structure with multiple packages:

- **apps/frontend**: Main frontend application (Vite + React)
- **packages/contract-integration**: Blockchain contract interactions
- **packages/metadata**: Metadata handling and validation
- **packages/storage**: IPFS storage integration

## Import Issues and Resolution

### Problem

1. ESM vs CommonJS compatibility issues:
   - The frontend uses ESM modules
   - Some package dependencies use CommonJS
   - TypeScript's `moduleResolution` settings needed adjustment

2. Workspace package resolution:
   - Vite had difficulty resolving workspace package imports
   - Package path resolution was inconsistent between dev and build

### Solution

We implemented a pragmatic workaround:

1. **Local Module Approach**: 
   - Created a local copy of the contract-integration code in the frontend
   - Simplified dependencies and interfaces
   - Removed complex integrations that weren't immediately needed

2. **Interface Isolation**:
   - Created simplified versions of shared interfaces
   - Removed unused functionality for MVP development

3. **Path Configuration**:
   - Updated tsconfig.json to include proper path mappings
   - Modified Vite configuration for workspace resolution

## Future Improvements

1. **Proper Package Structure**:
   - Standardize on ESM for all packages
   - Use consistent moduleResolution settings

2. **Build Process**:
   - Implement proper build order for dependencies
   - Use bundled packages for distribution

3. **Testing**:
   - Add tests for package integration
   - Validate imports work in all environments

## Notes for Developers

When adding new dependencies between packages:

1. Ensure consistent module resolution settings in tsconfig.json
2. Test imports in both dev and build environments
3. Consider the implications of circular dependencies
4. Document any workarounds needed for specific packages

For the current MVP development, prioritize functionality over perfect architecture. We can refactor the package structure once core functionality is working.
